## Connecting to Materialize instances

Access to the database is through the balancerd pods on:
* Port 6875 for SQL connections.
* Port 6876 for HTTP(S) connections.

Access to the web console is through the console pods on port 8080.

#### TLS support

For example purposes, optional TLS support is provided by using `cert-manager` and a self-signed `ClusterIssuer`.

More advanced TLS support using user-provided CAs or per-Materialize `Issuer`s are out of scope for this Terraform module. Please refer to the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/) for detailed guidance on more advanced usage.

###### To enable installation of `cert-manager` and configuration of the self-signed `ClusterIssuer`
1. Set `install_cert_manager` to `true`.
1. Run `terraform apply`.
1. Set `use_self_signed_cluster_issuer` to `true`.
1. Run `terraform apply`.

Due to limitations in Terraform, it cannot plan Kubernetes resources using CRDs that do not exist yet. We need to first install `cert-manager` in the first `terraform apply`, before defining any `ClusterIssuer` or `Certificate` resources which get created in the second `terraform apply`.
